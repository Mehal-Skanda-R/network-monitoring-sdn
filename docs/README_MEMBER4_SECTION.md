# Project Integration and Documentation

## Integration overview

The application combines UDP host telemetry, SDN switch-flow statistics and
the monitoring detector. The integration helper in `integration/pipeline.py`
provides two entry points:

- `handle_telemetry(...)` for messages decoded by the central UDP server.
- `handle_flow_stats(...)` for cumulative counters collected from the SDN
  switch through the controller/statistics component.

Both methods forward the original agreed field names to the existing
`NetworkDetector`. The pipeline publishes only the nested `alerts` entries,
not the complete measurement result. `stats_receiver.py` receives Ryu's UDP
flow-statistics datagrams on port 9998 and calls the pipeline.

## Repository structure

    integration/
        __init__.py
        pipeline.py
    monitoring/
        detector.py
    docs/
        INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md
        TESTING_GUIDE.md
        DEMO_GUIDE.md

The structure above is illustrative. Preserve any additional files already
present in the shared repository.

## Setup and execution

Follow the project's main README and the team's confirmed Ubuntu/Mininet and
controller setup instructions. The integration helper assumes the existing
`monitoring` package is importable from the project root.

## Verification status

The integration code and documentation are prepared from the project context
brief. They have not been executed against the current private GitHub
repository or the other members' implementations. Confirm callback wiring,
detector return types and controller interfaces before merging.

## Assignment alignment

This contribution supports socket–SDN integration, reproducible documentation,
testing coordination and final demonstration preparation. Dynamic SDN behavior,
Mininet deployment and end-to-end performance measurements must be implemented
and verified with the responsible team members.
