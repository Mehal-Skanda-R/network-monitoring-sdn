# Demonstration Guide — Question 6

## Demo objective

Demonstrate that host telemetry is transported using UDP, actual SDN switch
flow statistics are collected, the monitoring detector calculates traffic
rates, configured thresholds produce alerts, and the SDN controller performs
the required dynamic behavior.

## Suggested demonstration sequence

1. Explain the topology and identify the Mininet hosts and Open vSwitch.
2. Show that the SDN controller is connected to the switch.
3. Start the UDP telemetry agents and central UDP monitoring server.
4. Show telemetry arriving at the server from multiple hosts.
5. Generate traffic between selected Mininet hosts.
6. Show actual switch flow-counter samples being collected.
7. Explain that the first counter sample is a baseline and later samples allow
   rate calculation.
8. Demonstrate a normal-traffic case.
9. Demonstrate a configured abnormal-traffic case and show the detector alert.
10. Demonstrate the controller's dynamic SDN response. An alert printout alone
    is not evidence of dynamic SDN functionality.
11. Present measured performance results and compare the selected baseline
    with the monitored/SDN-controlled case.
12. Show the repository, test cases and setup documentation.
